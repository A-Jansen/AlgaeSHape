# AlgaeShape
This is a final bachelor project for the study Industrial Design at the TU/e. The notebooks are used to analyse the data gathered during experiments with sodium alginate and textiles.
If no units are given the following are used:
cm, g, min, %

The datasets used in the notebooks for material analysis can be found in the folder Datasets Material Tests. The dataset gathered from the user tests cannot be found here due to privacy reasons. If you want to run the code, you must make a folder with both the notebook and csv files in there. The needed csv files are listed in the notebooks.
